  <description>Twitch integration with RimConnect extension
  
  This mod is still a work in progress and not yet available for Beta testing.

  By using this mod, you can connect to the RimConnect extension and create polls to create events in your game.

  Either the broadcaster or a moderator can create polls, and all users may vote on what they want to happen.
